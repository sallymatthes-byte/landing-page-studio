Create beautiful landing pages with AI-generated images using Claude Code.

## Quick Start

## Example Request

> Create a landing page for a cozy coffee shop called "Morning Brew". They specialize in artisan coffee and fresh pastries. Warm, inviting feeling. Include sections for menu highlights, about us, and location.

## Your Landing Pages

After creating pages, they'll be available at:
- `your-subdomain.com/` — Main page
- `your-subdomain.com/coffee-shop/` — Individual pages
- `your-subdomain.com/another-page/` — And so on...
